Open a Ubuntu shell. Create and go to the directory where you would like to create your first SC_HelloWorld project.
Start Visual Studio Code by typing this command.

```bash
code .
```

This should start a Visual Studio Code editor and connect it with Ubuntu via WSL. Make sure the WSL link it visible at Bottom-Left corner. If it does not connect automatically connect, connect it manually.

Install the C/C++ extension, CMake extension to WSL from the Extensions menu.

Now, the VS Code is successfully connected to the WSL and it is ready to go.

Create a .vscode folder from the Explorer menu on the left side panel.

Inside this folder we are going to create 3 files:

* c_cpp_properties.json
* settings.json
* tasks.json

Here is how c_cpp_properties.json should look like:

```bash
{
    "env": {
        "SYSTEMC_PATH": "../../mnt/e/Documents/Code/systemc-3.0.1"
    },
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "systemc",
            "browse": {
                "path": [
                    "${workspaceFolder}",
                    "/mnt/e/Documents/Code/systemc-3.0.1/src",
                    "/mnt/e/Documents/Code/systemc-3.0.1/include"
                ],
                "limitSymbolsToIncludedHeaders": false
            },
            "includePath": [
                "${workspaceFolder}/**",
		        "/mnt/e/Documents/Code/systemc-3.0.1/src/**",
                "/mnt/e/Documents/Code/systemc-3.0.1/include/**"
            ],
            "defines": [],
            "cStandard": "c17",
            "cppStandard": "c++17",
            "intelliSenseMode": "gcc-x64"
        }
    ],
    "version": 4
}
```

This is how settings.json would look like:

```bash
{
    "C_Cpp.errorSquiggles": "enabled",
    "cmake.cmakePath": "/usr/bin/cmake",
    "C_Cpp.default.compilerPath": "/usr/bin/gcc"
}
```
This is how tasks.json would look like:

```bash
{
    "tasks": [
        {
            "type": "cppbuild",
            "label": "C/C++: g++ build active file",
            "command": "/usr/bin/g++",
            "args": [
                "-fdiagnostics-color=always",
                "-I/mnt/e/Documents/Code/systemc-3.0.1/include",
                "-g",
                "${file}",
                "-o",
                "${fileDirname}/${fileBasenameNoExtension}"
            ],
            "options": {
                "cwd": "${fileDirname}"
            },
            "problemMatcher": [
                "$gcc"
            ],
            "group": {
                "kind": "build",
                "isDefault": true
            },
            "detail": "Task generated by Debugger."
        }
    ],
    "version": "2.0.0"
}
```

We are planning to add a file called helloworld.cpp. Lets create a CMakeLists.txt file for it as below:

```bash
set (CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.5.0)
project(SC_HelloWorld VERSION 0.1.0 LANGUAGES C CXX)


include_directories("/mnt/e/Documents/Code/systemc-3.0.1/src")
link_directories("/mnt/e/Documents/Code/systemc-3.0.1/lib-linux64")

# Create a sources variable with a link to all cpp files to compile
set(SOURCES
    helloworld.cpp
)

add_executable(SC_HelloWorld ${SOURCES})
target_link_libraries(SC_HelloWorld libsystemc.so)

set(CPACK_PROJECT_NAME ${PROJECT_NAME})
set(CPACK_PROJECT_VERSION ${PROJECT_VERSION})
include(CPack)
```

This concludes our environment setup for the SC_HelloWorld project. In the next article I will walk through the helloworld.cpp file.
